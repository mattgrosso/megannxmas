        <p>You now own: <span>megannslater.com</span></p>
        <p>Use it however you like. Maybe it's not something you think you need right now but owning your own name may be something you'll be happy about in the future.</p>
        <p>This is your platform for whatever you want to put out there.</p>
        <p>Yours is an important voice.</p>
        <p>Be heard.</p>
